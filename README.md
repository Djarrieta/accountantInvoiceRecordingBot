# accountantInvoiceRecordingBot

I am pleased to present to you my idea for a Telegram-based application that would aid your company in automating and streamlining the accounting process. The application would receive photos of invoices and audio recordings through Telegram and use AI to transcribe the audio into pre-established actionable instructions. Then, using Python, these actions would be executed and ChatGPT, another AI, would be utilized to generate responses in natural language.
The application would take care of saving the invoice photos with the appropriate name in the appropriate folder, making it easier for your accounting assistant to work with. Additionally, it will extract important information from the invoices like the total amount spent, which would help to have a better control of the expenses. By automating this process, human errors would be reduced and time and effort would be saved on administrative tasks.
I am confident that this application would be a great addition for your company and I would love to have the opportunity to discuss further details with you. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or are interested in proceeding with the project.

Functional programming in Python is proposed with a state that manages the global variables of the application and functions that receive this state and modify it or generate actions and do not modify the state.
